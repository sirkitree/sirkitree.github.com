# System Patterns

## System Architecture
- Static site generated by Jekyll from Markdown and HTML sources.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages with custom domain support.
- Blog posts and pages use custom layouts and Liquid templates.
- Automation scripts (Node.js, Python) for asset and content management.
- AngularJS (1.0.7) used in subprojects for interactive demos and experiments.

## Key Technical Decisions
- Use of Jekyll for static site generation for simplicity and portability.
- GitHub Pages for free, reliable hosting and easy deployment.
- Markdown for content authoring.
- Custom theming and layouts for branding and UX.
- Disqus for comments integration.
- Node.js (Puppeteer) and Python (BeautifulSoup) scripts for automation.

## Design Patterns
- Convention-over-configuration for content and layouts.
- Modular directory structure for posts, assets, scripts, and subprojects.
- Use of Liquid templating for dynamic content rendering.
- Automation scripts follow single-responsibility and are self-contained.
