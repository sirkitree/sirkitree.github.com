# Progress

## What Works
- Jekyll builds and serves the site locally and on GitHub Pages
- Blog post and static page publishing
- Custom layouts, theming, and navigation
- Disqus comments integration
- Automation scripts for thumbnail generation and project import
- AngularJS subprojects and experiments

## What's Left to Build
- Ongoing content creation and curation
- Potential new automation scripts or integrations
- Continuous improvement of design and UX

## Current Status
- Site is live, functional, and actively maintained
- Memory Bank documentation initialized

## Known Issues
- Must ensure all automation scripts remain compatible with Jekyll and GitHub Pages
- AngularJS subprojects are legacy and may require updates for modern browsers
