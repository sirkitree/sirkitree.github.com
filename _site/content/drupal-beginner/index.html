  <p>Don&#39;t cry, it&#39;s true. But let me tell you about how I first came about <a href="drupal.org" target="_blank">my savior</a>.</p>

<p>My first Drupal child was a project we call the Resource Center. When I say we, I mean Shawn Priesz, Kevin Poust, and me. I started off with writing a login system for a project Shawn had built that takes registered users from our main company&#39;s website (<a href='http://www.c-sgroup.com' target='_blank' title='Construction Specialties, Inc - USA'>c-sgroup.com</a>) and gives our sales representatives the information of those users, that live in their respective area, along with what product details they were downloading. I know what you&#39;re thinking, &#39;Big Brother type stuff, eh?&#39;. Well maybe a little, but these are our <strong>REGISTERED</strong> users and they know that their information is kept within the company. Or at least that&#39;s what helps <em>me</em> sleep at night. In any case, we needed a way for our sales reps to log in before they could see the information so that it was not readily available to just anyone.</p>

<p>So I worked for a while on a login script and built it around this reporting program (after converting it from ASP to PHP) and finally had a working system when alas, I found Drupal. Praise be. A system that already did what I was looking to do <strong><em>AND MORE</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I devoured it, finding that not only was it free, but there were literally a TON of developers using and developing for Drupal. The modules came into site after my first initial shock wore off at all of the already prepackaged features, and then I started in on my own development.</p>

<p>Well, I really had no idea at first of how to develop a module, and quite frankly was a tad bit intimidated to try something of the like, so I resorted to inserted PHP code within custom pages and linking around ever so sloppily. But hey, we all start somewhere right? I was a beginner DrupalHEAD and I have the scars to prove it. Mainly mental scars that you can&#39;t really see unless you sit beside me while I rework old code from a month or so ago. Then you hear a lot of &#39;Daaang it!&#39;s with Nepoleon Dynamite&#39;s inflection. I had this folder in the Drupal root I called &#39;myblocks&#39; and stuck all of my PHP code in there with a few links to scripts I would throw into the root/scripts/ folder... I&#39;m a bit embarrassed of all this by now, but I really have no shame.</p>

<p>Between here and there I came across Ajax, and all of it&#39;s wonders and took a bit of a break from the daily Drupal grind to relearn all of the javascript I had started out with almost 9 years ago. But you can <a href="http://www.thethisorthat.com/ajax-app-development" target="_blank">read about that</a> over at <a href="http://thethisorthat.com" target="_blank">thethisorthat.com</a>, one of my subsites run by my good friend <a href="http://blog.linkworth.com/pubcon-linkworth-happy-hour-a-success/" target="_blank">INSANE Dave</a>.</p>

<p>But then came a point where I really wanted to start a fresh module and get my hands dripping red (blue?) in Drupal&#39;s inner core. I had gotten this email from a guy at work who thought it would be a good idea to display internal job openings on the Resource Center, so I got together with Human Resources and start hacking out a module. I started by reading the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/508" target="_blank">Module developer&#39;s guide</a> and tore apart a simple module (don&#39;t remember which one) and it went form there like wildfire. I couldn&#39;t get enough. Everything went into a module. I redeveloped all of the &#39;myblocks&#39; crap into modules after I finished the iPost module (will post it later, this is the internal job listings module I made for HR). During the redevelopment of those, I we started wanting to put other sites into Drupal. Namely, <a href='http://www.grand-entrance.com'>Grand Entrance,</a>, which is like a sub company of ours that sells our products.</p>

<p>From there we knew it was going to expand even more because of the ease of use and management that Drupal provides. So while I did research into Drupal multisite functionality, Shawn was busy learning and setting up everything for subversion. I&#39;ll post sometime on my experience with that, but for now suffice to say, that if you are a developer, and you have not begun using subversion, DO IT! DO IT NOW! I seriously do not know what I did before subversion came into my life. This has been more a passion of Shawn&#39;s, but I&#39;ve reaped many of the benefits. Even if you don&#39;t use it the correct way, which I&#39;m still not sure I do entirely, for backup purposes alone it is a must.</p>

<p>But enough ranting on that, I&#39;m focusing on Drupal multisites now. The basis of a drupal multisite is this: you have a domain, in fact, multiple domains, that point to the same core Drupal install. Drupal then routes the request to it&#39;s /sites folder and looks for a folder with the requested uri. This folder, contains a settings.php which defines the database in which the site runs, and wala! That&#39;s really all there is too it. One Drupal install, multiple database, multiple sites. So simple, yet so ingenious it makes me emotional.... well not really emotional, more sexually... no that&#39;s not it either... nevermind.</p>

<p>So what have we learned here today boys and ... well I doubt if you&#39;re a girl you&#39;ve made it this far &#39;cuz I don&#39;t know hardly any girls that speak techbabble.</p>

<p><ol>
  <li>Drupal is the lord your god in code format.</li>
  <li>If you can&#39;t find a Drupal module to do it for you, start by developing a real Drupal module and not trying to &#39;just get by&#39; on mashed up code.</li>
  <li>Multisite Drupal installs are an easy thing to learn, and well worth the time, (1-2 minutes) to setup if you have multiple sites that you want to run through Drupal.</li>
  <li>This Jerad guy probably never gets a date.</li>
