  <section class="content">
  <p>A couple months ago (right after I made a big move) I started hearing thing about the financial crisis and banks going under. Talking with my friend who travels a lot, I came to hear that when America sneezes, the rest of the world gets a cold. Another friend of mine introduced me to a film called &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;. With the uncertainty of living in a new area, trying to gain respect at a new job, and making new friends, I started worrying. Actually worrying is an understatement, but I&#39;ll not be dramatic.</p>

<p>However, after hearing about Lullabot&#39;s new venture, and especially Ed Sussman&#39;s blog post, &quot;<a href="http://www.lullabot.com/blog/edward-sussman-why-start-now">Why Start (Up) Now?</a>&quot; I gained a little hope. Then I got a <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinrose/statuses/975842840">twitter from Kevin Rose</a> today where he talked about Paul Graham&#39;s post, &quot;<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/badeconomy.html">Why to Start a Startup in a Bad Economy</a>&quot;. I must say that I&#39;m feeling better. Again an understatement, but dramatics really aren&#39;t my thing.</p>

<p>The thought of having a startup has always appealed to me. I even have <a href="http://lullabot.com">friends</a> <a href="http://zivtech.com">who</a> <a href="http://parentsclick.com">have</a> done them. And though I&#39;ve always <a href="http://sonybmg.com">played</a> it <a href="http://www.shscares.org">safe</a> by <a href="c-sgroup.com">working</a> for <a href="http://mylifetime.com">corporations</a>, I&#39;ve always wanted to have my own business, startup or consulting, to call my own. It&#39;s looking more and more like now is the time to get my nose to the grindstone. I&#39;m not planning on quitting my job anytime soon, but now is the time to invest.</p>

<p><a href="http://thethisorthat.com">Dave</a> and I have been in the middle of revitalizing <a href="http://drupalmao.com">DrupaLMAO</a> (here&#39;s a quick <a href="http://img.skitch.com/20081026-p9gy1k8m26nhp51tu91xgb7srk.jpg">sneak peak</a>) to incorporate the Drupal community into our show by getting feedback from them in the form of voting upon the content on the site (via the <a href="http://drupal.org/planet">Drupal Planet</a>). Hopefully this will help get the community&#39;s involvement in the show as we&#39;ll talk about the things that the readers care about. We&#39;re coming out with a new episode any day now, it&#39;s taped, waiting on our editor ;) and while we wait, we&#39;re redesigning, rethinking and migrating to Drupal 6 (WIN!). Though this may not be startup material, it is nonetheless paramount to have a presence in the community... and it&#39;s just damn good fun!</p>

<p>Another project I&#39;m soon to have underway, came about from the fact that I get contacted by recruiters on a weekly basis looking for Drupal talent. Drupal hackers are in <strong>VERY HIGH DEMAND</strong> and there are many corporations out there now who are willing to pay top dollar for some of the best Drupal talent. While I may not be up there on the &quot;high talent scale&quot;, I keep a good relationship with these recruiters by offering advice on where to find Drupal talent, and how to go about it. They&#39;re quite often taken by surprise at the amount of resources that are actually out there to help them find who or what they&#39;re looking for, and some are a little discouraged by the advice I give. Especially when I tell them that they may be better off hiring one good Drupal developer who can teach a team of PHP developers how to use Drupal. Sounds like a good consulting strategy too ;) So after talking with endless recruiters, and regurgitating the same advice time and again, I&#39;m convinced that there is a huge need to connect employers, recruiters and Drupal talent. There are no real good solutions out there that have the community backing them so in the next few weeks I&#39;ll be on irc looking for ways to get this going. I&#39;ve got a good idea in the front of my mind (rather then the back) but I want to build something that is going to have the community behind it and hopefully get d.o involved, not just another lame job board.</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re out there looking down, thinking the end is neigh... think again. Read the posts mentioned above, and be inspired.</p>
