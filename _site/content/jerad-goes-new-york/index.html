  <p>So it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve posted, and there has been so much going on in my life. I&#39;ve moved to New York City to work with Sony BMG making websites for rockstars. I gotta say, it&#39;s been a HUGE change for me. My calm, collected country life where I lived all alone in the woods with the ability to go camping in my back yard was replaced by the hustle and bustle of New York City, staying in a studio apartment next to the Empire State building.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been searching for an apartment, and there are lots available, but nothing seems to be what I really want and everything is just so expensive. There is one in Hoboken I&#39;m going to be looking at this week and hopefully that will be it, but there is another one close to Hoboken, next to Washington Park, that Dave and I looked at today that was perfect. It&#39;s a little more expensive and there is a brokers fee so I may have to borrow from family to get into the place. I really don&#39;t want to do that, and would rather have the place in Hoboken so that I can feel like I&#39;m doing it all on my own, but then my bank account still hasn&#39;t received my first paycheck from Sony and I&#39;m worried that they haven&#39;t setup my direct deposit yet. That means they&#39;ve mailed my check and I won&#39;t get it until Monday or Tuesday, then I have to get it deposited into my account back home. Only after that will i be able to setup the rent.com escrow account in order to get the keys form the guy who owns the place in Hoboken. He&#39;s living in Athens Greece, so we have to do it this way. So as you can imagine, with only 9 days or so to get moved and into a place, I&#39;m stressing. </p>

<p>However, there are a few other possibilities, like Dave getting the same benefits as myself and hanging with him wherever Sony puts him, but that&#39;s not going to happen before I have to get out of the place I&#39;m at now. So I guess I&#39;m really banking on this place in Hoboken... ah stress...</p>
