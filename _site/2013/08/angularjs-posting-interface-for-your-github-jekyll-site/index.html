<p>After getting a decent way to create a file on GitHub just using a POST from a form as <a href="http://brockboland.com/2013/07/jekyll-posting-interface/">Brock Boland</a> spoke about with his Jekyll posting interface, I thought I would take this one step further and figure out a way to use the <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a> to create that file instead of taking you to GitHub&#39;s new file interface. This was much easier than I expected.</p>

<h2>GitHub.js</h2>

<p>I did a little searching for AngularJS and GitHub authentication and came across <a href="https://github.com/michael/github">GitHub.js</a> which (to my delight and surprise) is now being maintained by none other than my friends at <a href="https://github.com/developmentseed">DevelopmentSeed</a>! This gives the browser a complete javascript library for working with the GitHub API and is simply perfect for the job.</p>

<p>I added a username and password field to my <a href="/new.html">post interface</a> and setup an AngularJS controller to utilize this library.</p>

<p><code>$scope.github</code> now has access to all of the nifty functions that GitHub.js provides. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/sirkitree/sirkitree.github.com/blob/master/js/githubpost.js">full controller</a> which uses the <code>GitHub.getRepo</code> and <code>repo.write</code> in order to create a new file in my _posts directory in markdown format with the appropriate YAML headers. GitHub then runs it through Jekyll and the result is what you&#39;re reading now.</p>
