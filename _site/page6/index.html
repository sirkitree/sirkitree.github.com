      <p>There&#39;s an ideal of late that I&#39;ve seen repeated within literature and movies that intrigues me. It is that of the men and women who have ideals. Ideals that they do whatever it takes to uphold. I find this a respectable character trait that I find myself wanting to mimic. To uphold.<br /><br />When you see wrong being done what do you do?<br /><br />When you see something happening that you do not agree with, what do you do?<br /><br />When there are ideals being upheld by the populace that you do not agree with, not becuase you are bias or jaded or just plain sick of, but because you KNOW beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are absolutely wrong, what do you do?<br /><br />Some choose to do more, some choose to hide, some choose to reason that they&#39;re not the one who can do anything about those things that hide in the dark of the mind and pervert the perception of those that would stand for what is right. But YOU know what is RIGHT. You KNOW what is WRONG. And even though you doubt yourself and how you feel about the subject of the matter, you KNOW in that inner most place that is untainted, unforgettable, unmoving... you KNOW.<br /><br />So do something about it! And the world will recognize as well, because they know as well, even though they may ignore it, even though they may reason it away... they know. And will support you if you are the one who champions the cause of WHAT IS RIGHT!<br /></p>

      <p>This weekend I&#39;m leaving for PA for a week long vacation of nature, family and friends. Saturday I hope to be going to the Lycoming County Fair, Sunday going to see Wall-E with a friend. I&#39;ll also be using my spare time over the weekend to get everything ready for a three day backpacking trip through the mountains where I grew up. I&#39;ve not been out there by myself in years and I really want to just take my time hiking through the mountains around Rose Valley Lake where I grew up.<br /><br />When I return from that, I&#39;ll be heading out to the family cabin in Belleville where a family reunion is taking place, full of family on my mother&#39;s side. Great Aunts and Uncles and hopefully time enough to talk with them all to glean what wisdom I may from them. I&#39;ve come to think that you have to know where you come from in order to figure out where to go next in life. And that&#39;s the big question I ask myself every so often, so hopefully some time alone, and then with family and friends will help me figure that one out.<br /><br />Next weekend I&#39;ll be home at my mother&#39;s then, visiting with her, my brothers and my father&#39;s parents who will be visiting. I think we&#39;re planning on going to Ricket&#39;s Glen where there is some nice camping, a good place to hike some waterfalls, and a beach on the lake for swimming.<br /></p>

      <p>For a long time I&#39;ve thought that a major distinction in life that people must try to make is the difference between needs and wants. I&#39;ve told many of my friends that if they just try to make this distinction in their own life, they will live a much happier, balanced life.</p>

<p>I was going through an old hard drive today and found many of my old writings on lots of different topics, but this one just jumped out at me as it is probably one of the most profound truths and holds some of the most engaging questions of life. The entry is dated 1-11-07:</p>

<p><cite>We&#39;ve got to stop thinking that we are the only ones that matter.</cite>
<cite>Where does one find the strength to accomplish such a feat? What is the formula for molding one&#39;s self unto this task? We all want something greater than what we already experience in this life, but we must learn to separate that which we want, from that which is needed. </cite>
<cite>Define what is needed.</cite>
<cite>Can we tell by ourselves what is needed, or is it defined by those around us? Should it be defined by those around us, or by something greater? If by something greater, then what is that greater something? If by those around us, then whom?</cite></p>

<p>I&#39;ve pondered on these things most of my conscious life, and still look for the answers. I doubt I will ever stop.</p>

      <p>Swept away are the remnants of old, smaller dreams thought too impossible now become reality, even though torn<br/>
Reality torn asunder, pulling back the curtain to reveal the secrets of life lived fully, unhindered by shame<br/>
Shameful regrets, swept away, replaced by a new reality, revealed through conscious will and positive karmic energy<br/>
Positive energies flow through willful projections when unhindered by fear, guided by respect and discipline<br/>
Respect being key, replaces that which eats at everyones soul of late, fear and the assumption of security, apathy</br>
<br/>
Swept away and free to dream, your life becomes clay in which to mold a destiny, in harmony with the lines which exist<br/>
See the lines, look ahead down that path which your decision may take you to make a wise choice... prosper<br/>
Fear and doubt be swept away, leaving assured security molded by discipline and experience, always increasing, improving<br/>
Constant reshaping of thoughts and patterns of reasoning, learning to optimize, conceptualize, visualize<br/>
Look forward to what is to come, and what will be swept away</p>
