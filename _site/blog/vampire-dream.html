        <meta name="description" content="I had a pretty in depth adventure in my dreams last night so I downloaded ommwriter to capture them in the wee morning hours as soon as I awoke. Ommwriter is pretty nice, the music and the interface really helped for this kind of writing and I think would inspire me to write more poetry. I’m still listening to the music as I type this up in my blog. Anyway, here are some notes on the things I remember from the dream. Should turn this into a short story.


  start out searching for lost people down a dark hallway
  hole in the wall
  go through to find a vampire playing pool, trying to make crazy shots, like off the table, off the wall
  knock off the cue ball from a precarious position
  pisses off the vampire and I run
  fall down a story, over a banister, into a pool of water
  notice the missing childrens possessions
  notice the missing children, wrapped up in cacoons made of the green weeds lining the bottom of the pool
  pull some of the cacoons to the surface
  free the children
  vampire comes and i set her on fire, first her hair, then with gasoline
  throw more gasoline up the stairway and onto her brothers
  light the trail and run
  i am vampire
  they search for me
  they find me, and we run from the mother, scatter
  i am alone, running through backyards, pissed
  there is a pool made of runoff, collected rain in a tarp, redneck pool, in which a male and female human lounge
  i am pissed, redneck floating is pissed i’m in his pool making waves
  i jump out, apologise, he threatens me
  i am pissed so i tell him to hit me with whatever he has, a couple huge bottles
  i warn him i may have some vampiric blood in me and need to feed afterwards
  he doesn’t really understand what i’ve said and is rearing to hit me anyway
  my brother appears, a werewolf and hairy, fangs bared
  he bites into the male human and the woman turns to scream
  i catch her and make he look into my eyes
  draw her mind into mine and tell her all is well
  remember well looking into her eyes, connecting with her mind, how it felt to draw her in, how she looked as i became her world, how it felt to have control

    <p>I had a pretty in depth adventure in my dreams last night so I downloaded <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/en/">ommwriter</a> to capture them in the wee morning hours as soon as I awoke. Ommwriter is pretty nice, the music and the interface really helped for this kind of writing and I think would inspire me to write more poetry. I’m still listening to the music as I type this up in my blog. Anyway, here are some notes on the things I remember from the dream. Should turn this into a short story.</p>

<ul>
  <li>start out searching for lost people down a dark hallway</li>
  <li>hole in the wall</li>
  <li>go through to find a vampire playing pool, trying to make crazy shots, like off the table, off the wall</li>
  <li>knock off the cue ball from a precarious position</li>
  <li>pisses off the vampire and I run</li>
  <li>fall down a story, over a banister, into a pool of water</li>
  <li>notice the missing childrens possessions</li>
  <li>notice the missing children, wrapped up in cacoons made of the green weeds lining the bottom of the pool</li>
  <li>pull some of the cacoons to the surface</li>
  <li>free the children</li>
  <li>vampire comes and i set her on fire, first her hair, then with gasoline</li>
  <li>throw more gasoline up the stairway and onto her brothers</li>
  <li>light the trail and run</li>
  <li>i am vampire</li>
  <li>they search for me</li>
  <li>they find me, and we run from the mother, scatter</li>
  <li>i am alone, running through backyards, pissed</li>
  <li>there is a pool made of runoff, collected rain in a tarp, redneck pool, in which a male and female human lounge</li>
  <li>i am pissed, redneck floating is pissed i’m in his pool making waves</li>
  <li>i jump out, apologise, he threatens me</li>
  <li>i am pissed so i tell him to hit me with whatever he has, a couple huge bottles</li>
  <li>i warn him i may have some vampiric blood in me and need to feed afterwards</li>
  <li>he doesn’t really understand what i’ve said and is rearing to hit me anyway</li>
  <li>my brother appears, a werewolf and hairy, fangs bared</li>
  <li>he bites into the male human and the woman turns to scream</li>
  <li>i catch her and make he look into my eyes</li>
  <li>draw her mind into mine and tell her all is well</li>
  <li>remember well looking into her eyes, connecting with her mind, how it felt to draw her in, how she looked as i became her world, how it felt to have control</li>
</ul>
