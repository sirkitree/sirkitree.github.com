I had a pretty in depth adventure in my dreams last night so I downloaded <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/en/">ommwriter</a> to capture them in the wee morning hours as soon as I awoke. Ommwriter is pretty nice, the music and the interface really helped for this kind of writing and I think would inspire me to write more poetry. I'm still listening to the music as I type this up in my blog. Anyway, here are some notes on the things I remember from the dream. Should turn this into a short story.

- start out searching for lost people down a dark hallway
- hole in the wall
- go through to find a vampire playing pool, trying to make crazy shots, like off the table, off the wall
- knock off the cue ball from a precarious position
- pisses off the vampire and I run
- fall down a story, over a banister, into a pool of water
- notice the missing childrens possessions
- notice the missing children, wrapped up in cacoons made of the green weeds lining the bottom of the pool
- pull some of the cacoons to the surface
- free the children
- vampire comes and i set her on fire, first her hair, then with gasoline
- throw more gasoline up the stairway and onto her brothers
- light the trail and run
- i am vampire
- they search for me
- they find me, and we run from the mother, scatter
- i am alone, running through backyards, pissed
- there is a pool made of runoff, collected rain in a tarp, redneck pool, in which a male and female human lounge
- i am pissed, redneck floating is pissed i'm in his pool making waves
- i jump out, apologise, he threatens me
- i am pissed so i tell him to hit me with whatever he has, a couple huge bottles
- i warn him i may have some vampiric blood in me and need to feed afterwards
- he doesn't really understand what i've said and is rearing to hit me anyway
- my brother appears, a werewolf and hairy, fangs bared
- he bites into the male human and the woman turns to scream
- i catch her and make he look into my eyes
- draw her mind into mine and tell her all is well
- remember well looking into her eyes, connecting with her mind, how it felt to draw her in, how she looked as i became her world, how it felt to have control
