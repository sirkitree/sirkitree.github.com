I found a great way to transfer photos from [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) or [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) to Picasa/[Google+](http://plus.google.com) quickly and easily, keeping albums intact using Mac OS X iPhoto '11.

**Step 1:**<br>
Download and install the [Picasa Web Albums Uploader](http://picasa.google.com/mac_tools.html).

**Step 2:**<br>
Within iPhoto, select iPhoto > Preferences and then the Accounts tab to connect to your Flickr account.<br>

**Step 3:**<br>
Within iPhoto, select the Flickr icon in your sidebar.<br>

**Step 4:**<br>
Within iPhoto, select the Flickr album you want to move and double click to open in order to make sure iPhoto retrieves all of the photos.<br>

**Step 5:**<br>
Within iPhoto, select File > Export and use the "Picasa Web Albums" tab to export your selected Flickr album right into Picasa.<br>

Upon signing into your Google Plus account, and viewing your albums, you should now see the exported album available.
