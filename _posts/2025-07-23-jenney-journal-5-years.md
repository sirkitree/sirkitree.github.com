Five years. I can hardly believe I'm writing these words. Five years since that terrifying February when our world turned upside down. Five years since brain surgery, since watching Jenney relearn our children's names, since those endless nights in the ICU. And we just received the news we've been praying for – Jenney is officially cancer free, no more scans needed, just annual visits. Praise God!

The oncologist delivered the news – "Five years clear, you've graduated." No more regular scans, just yearly check-ups. The same office where we once sat stunned by the word "glioblastoma" has now witnessed this incredible milestone.

I think back to those early days – the migraines that wouldn't stop, the emergency surgery while she was pregnant with Marcus, the fear that gripped my heart every single day. I remember pacing hospital hallways, making calendars to help her remember, watching our kids try to understand why mommy couldn't find her words.

And here we are. Marcus is a thriving 5-year-old who has never known a world without his mommy's hugs. Viola, Vincent, and Sebastian have watched their mother fight with a strength that has shaped who they are becoming. They've learned that faith isn't just for Sunday mornings – it's for the darkest nights and the longest waits.

Jenney has returned to everything she loves. She makes her calendars every year, filled with photos of our growing family. She volunteers at church, sharing her testimony of God's faithfulness. She mothers our children with the same fierce love she's always had, perhaps treasuring each moment even more deeply now.

The doctor explained that after five years with no recurrence, the statistics shift dramatically in our favor. No more MRIs every few months. No more holding our breath before each scan. Just annual check-ups, like a regular person. "Like a regular person" – words that feel like a miracle.

We will celebrate this milestone, remembering how far we've come. We'll thank God for this precious gift of time, for healing, for the army of people who carried us through the valley.

Five years cancer free. These aren't just medical words – they're a testament to God's grace, to the power of prayer, to the skill of doctors, and to Jenney's incredible spirit. They're proof that even in our darkest moments, hope can bloom.

To everyone who has walked this journey with us – who brought meals, sent prayers, donated to our GoFundMe, watched our kids, or simply sent a text saying you were thinking of us – thank you. You helped carry us to this day.

God is good, all the time. All the time, God is good.

Here's to the next five years, and the five after that, and all the years God grants us together. No more counting days between scans. Just counting our blessings, one beautiful day at a time.
