<img src="http://jeradbitner.com/files/cody_tattoo.jpg" style="float:left; width: 223px; height: 220px; margin-right:10px;" /> Here's Cody's tattoo. I'm going to schedule mine sometime this week, and Chris has his scheduled for next Saturday. I've also attached the original that Cody based his off of.

From left to right, top to bottom, those are my initials, Bryant's initials, my Dad's initials in the center, Cody's initials, and Chris's initials.

We had all planned on getting this tattoo together with our Dad, but he died before we ever got a chance to do so. If you ever have a chance to do something like this with your father, don't wait. Do it as soon as possible. You will not regret it.
