```
Angel of fire, wings of light
  Visit me in my dreams tonight
  Tell me of love and burning desire
  Caress my lips, set me on fire

Angel of fire, eyes so bright
  See through my soul, feel the fright
  Singe my heart and look for the liar
  Scar on my sould cleanse with your fire
  Transcendance lost on the blackening shame
  Licked by lips that are black from the flame

Angel of fire, cleanse me just right
  Leaving your mark steal through the night
  Tease my mind leaving desire
  Tease my heart scarred by your fire
  Knowing we'll never ever be the same
  Learn from our past, never do this again
