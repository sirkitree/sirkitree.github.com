For a while, I've been annoyed by the default way Drupal displays it's login box automatically if you're not signed in. So I usually just put a link in the footer or primary links to 'user' after enabling clean urls. This works great, but when I did it with Drupal 5, I found that the link that should be entitled <em>Login</em>, was changed to <em>My account</em>!
