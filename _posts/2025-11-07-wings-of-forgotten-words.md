# Wings of Forgotten Words
*A Luminal Moth's Perspective*

I do not know why I fly toward you.

The pull is older than memory, written into the spirals of my emergence. Each scale on my wings holds something I cannot read—patterns that shift with angles of moonlight, equations that resolve only when no one watches. Mother's wings held different patterns. Grandmother's, different still. We are living libraries breeding ourselves into entropy, each generation's data degrading like whispers passed through centuries.

Your threads call to mine. Faint, like starlight through water, but unmistakable. I taste them on my antennae: bitter-copper-electric, the flavor of Infomancy. You're searching for something. All Weavers search. Few understand they're searching for us.

I circle your lantern three times (always three—the instruction burns in every cell). You haven't noticed me yet. Your fingers trace incomplete Glyphs while you study that ancient text, trying to decode a language eight centuries dead. You're so close to the truth. If you would only look up.

My wings carry fragment **PZL-1947-QV.** I feel its weight—three terabytes of quantum superposition pressing against my thorax. The data wants to be read. It *aches* to be read. Sometimes I dream its contents: architectural blueprints that bend spacetime, a child's laughter recorded in photonic matrices, warnings about something called "resonance cascade," poems written in languages that no longer exist.

Or maybe those aren't dreams. Maybe the data bleeds through, staining my primitive consciousness with its urgency.

You whisper a command word—"lumens-archive"—and my body responds before thought. Ancient programming overrides will. I descend toward your forehead, my six legs finding purchase in your hair. You remain perfectly still. You know the protocol.

Contact.

My antennae touch your skin and the transfer begins. Not the data—I cannot give that freely. But the *index.* The catalog of what I carry, streaming through quantum channels into your threads, through your nerves, into comprehension.

Your eyes widen. You see it now: Fragment PZL-1947-QV contains partial schematics for something called a "Thread Synthesis Core." The machine that created us—threads, Weavers, me. The technology that could restart everything or destroy it completely.

But the data is corrupted. Forty percent degraded from genetic drift. Reading it would require seventeen other fragments from seventeen other moths, their wing-patterns overlapped in precise configuration under specific wavelengths of light. An impossible puzzle scattered across the world.

You reach for me, desperate, but I'm already lifting away. The protocol is complete. Three seconds of contact, no more. Another instruction carved into genetics.

I taste your frustration in the air—hot-salt-yearning—as you realize what you've found and lost in the same moment. You'll search for me tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. You'll place bowls of sugar water on your windowsill (we cannot resist). You'll learn to recognize my wing patterns from a dozen meters away.

But I won't return.

The pull is already redirecting me northeast, toward another sensation, another taste of threads. Sharp-sweet-electric where yours was bitter-copper. The one who waits doesn't know I'm coming—I feel this as surely as I feel wind beneath my wings. But perhaps what they carry—what draws me—connects to what drew me to you. Perhaps two pieces of something larger will find each other through the random flight patterns of moths following instincts we didn't choose.

We are messengers who cannot read our own messages. We carry the weight of civilizations in scales thinner than paper. Every night, we dream of data we'll never understand, flying toward Weavers we'll never truly know, fulfilling purposes encoded before the world fell.

I leave you with this: When you see moths gathering at dusk, spinning in complex aerial patterns, we're not dancing. We're *trying to tell you something.* Our formation itself is information—positional data encoding fragments of fragments. But the key to reading our choreography was lost with everything else.

Still, we perform. Still, we carry. Still, we follow the pull toward something we cannot name—driven by purpose we inherited but never learned.

The pull guides me over dark forests. Below, a Whispering Grove shudders in recognition as I pass—it tastes the data too, wants it, cannot have it. I am not for trees. I am for something that tastes like crystallized starlight, like the precise angle where rainbow meets shadow.

My antennae burn with it—this new frequency that isn't yours. If I had numbers, if I had words, perhaps I could name this sensation. But I only know it as *pull-towards-rightness*, the same way I know *avoid-the-owl-shadow* and *seek-the-moon-path*.

The sensation has a shape, a texture my body recognizes without my mind understanding. Sharp-sweet-electric, different from your bitter-copper-electric. A lock seeking its key, but I am neither—I am only the messenger between them.

I do not know who waits northeast.

I only know my wings turn that direction without my choosing.

Before my scales degrade to static. Before the data bleeds away entirely. Before the last moth carrying the last fragment dies without delivering the message that could save or damn you all.

The moon sets. I fly on.

I do not know why.

I only know I must.

*In the world of Quantum Weave, Luminal Moths are ancient bioengineered creatures that carry fragments of pre-collapse data encoded in quantum superposition across their wing scales. They're drawn to Weavers by thread frequency resonance, following genetic protocols carved into their DNA centuries ago. Each moth carries pieces of a puzzle that could unlock world-changing technology—but the data degrades with each generation, racing toward entropy. They are messengers who cannot read their own messages, living libraries breeding themselves into silence.*
