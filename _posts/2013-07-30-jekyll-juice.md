This blog is now powered by Jekyll alone (was on Octopress). [Brock Boland](http://brockboland.com) recently wrote about moving his blog to only Jekyll and I'd been wanting to do this for a while as well so I don't need to worry about generators and such at all. Only took about an hour. Generate a jekyll site with `jekyll new [site]` and then just move your posts over, tweak your settings and theme and you're done.

Theme is built with a little bit of [zurb foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/). I typically use Bootstrap for small projects but thought I'd give this a try instead. So far so good.
