## From Hospital Journal to Published Memoir

What started as desperate scribbles in hospital waiting rooms has become a 200+ page testament to the miracles we witnessed during Jenney's brain cancer journey. This book contains the full story—the parts I couldn't share in real-time, the moments too raw for blog posts, and the perspective that only comes with distance.
