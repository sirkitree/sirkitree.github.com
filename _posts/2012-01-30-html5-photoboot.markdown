After reading an [article](http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/01/hands-on-building-an-html5-photo-booth-with-chromes-new-webcam-api.ars) about the experimental support for WebRTC getting put into the latest version of browsers, my buddy [David Burns](https://plus.google.com/102577299588201077107/about) was inspired to write a quick app called [HTML5 Photobooth](http://html5photobooth.com/).
