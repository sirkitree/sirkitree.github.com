It's funny how perspective changes everything. As I sit here reflecting during Thanksgiving week, I'm struck by just how different things feel compared to a year ago. Sometimes you don't realize how far you've come until you take a moment to look back.

## Coming Home to Lullabot

One of the biggest blessings this year has been returning to Lullabot. It's more than just a job – it's like coming home. In an industry where empty promises about company culture are a dime a dozen, Lullabot stands out by actually walking the talk. They don't just say they value their people; they show it every day. The constant appreciation and acknowledgment might seem like small things, but man, they mean the world to me.

## Family is Everything

While work has been amazing, the real joy this year has been watching my family thrive. Especially Violet – seeing her in such a better place mentally compared to last year fills my heart with more gratitude than I can express. A year ago, we were facing some of our darkest moments when she tried to take her life. Today, she's flourishing, and that transformation is nothing short of miraculous.

## Personal Growth

I've done some growing of my own too. Last year was rough – depression had its hooks in deep, and I was wrestling with anger issues that I knew I needed to address. It's humbling to look back and see how far I've come. The work I've put into managing these challenges has paid off in ways I couldn't have imagined. I'm in a much better place now, mentally and emotionally.

## Looking Forward

There's something powerful about acknowledging our blessings, especially after coming through difficult times. This year has taught me that healing isn't just possible – it's happening all the time, even when we don't notice it. I'm grateful for the stability I've found, for my family's health and happiness, and for being part of a workplace that feels like family.

I'd love to hear what you're grateful for this year. Sometimes sharing our gratitude helps us see even more reasons to be thankful.

And now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go hug my family and send a thank you message to my Lullabot team – some things just shouldn't wait. ✌️
