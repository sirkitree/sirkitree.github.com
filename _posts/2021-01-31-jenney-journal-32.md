Things have been going really well as Jenney heals at home. She's back to doing everything she was always able to do, and our latest scans have shown no signs of cancer growth! Praise God!

Jenney gave her testimony at church today.

We'll be taking Jeanne home next weekend to San Diego, and staying with her for a couple of weeks before returning home. It'll be a long drive with the whole family, and God is with us. The change in weather will be a welcome respite from the cold, wet winter here. But I am excited for the beauty of spring in Washington!
