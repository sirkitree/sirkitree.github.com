I'm so fraking sore form Wii that it's not even funny. Well maybe a little bit funny... Snugs and his wife were in town as well as Dave, so we all hung out at Dana's, drank, and played Wii for 8 hours straight! It was a blast, a good time was had by all. This video is of Dave and Dana boxing, but we bowled a hell of a lot more. We almost all hit pro by the end of the night (3am). Too bad for Amy, who hurt her leg earlier in the day and was not able to bowl very much, but she did pretty well sitting down, even on her Vikoden! We also played with my Mac's PhotoBooth program, hilarity ensued. <object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/gYuacuTK_eU"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/gYuacuTK_eU" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object>
