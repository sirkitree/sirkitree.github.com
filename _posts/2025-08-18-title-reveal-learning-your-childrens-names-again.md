Today, I'm revealing the title and cover of my memoir: **"Learning Your Children's Names Again: A Memoir of Love, Brain Surgery, and the Miracles in Between."**

## Why This Title?

In the weeks following Jenney's brain surgery, there were moments—heartbreaking, surreal moments—when she couldn't recall our children's names. She had speech aphasia and would say the wrong word for various names of people and objects.

But this title isn't just about speech aphasia. It's about the deeper process of relearning—rediscovering who we are as individuals, as a couple, as a family when everything familiar gets stripped away.

It's about learning your children's names again not just as words, but as the people they become when crisis reshapes your family. Learning your spouse's name again as both patient and partner. Learning your own name again as you discover strengths you never knew you had.

## The Story Behind the Story

This memoir grew from the family journal I kept during Jenney's medical journey in 2020-2021. What started as a way to process fear and uncertainty became something larger—a testament to the miracles that happen not despite our hardest moments, but because of them.

You'll read about:

- The months of "just headaches" that weren't just headaches
- The day that changed everything
- Surgery day and the longest hours of our lives  
- Recovery, setbacks, and small victories
- Finding humor in the hardest places (because sometimes you laugh or you break)
- The family we became on the other side

## For My Original Readers

If you followed our story through the original journal posts on this site, thank you. Your comments, prayers, and support carried us through the darkest days. This book is the rest of the story—the parts I couldn't share then, the perspective I couldn't see in the middle of it all.

The journal posts will remain here as they were, but this memoir takes you deeper into the human story behind the medical updates.

## What's Next

The book officially launches soon, with pre-orders beginning shortly. I'll be sharing more about the journey—both the medical one and the writing one—in the weeks ahead.

For now, I hope you'll grab that first chapter and let me know what you think. After all, every story needs readers, and I'm grateful you're willing to be mine.
