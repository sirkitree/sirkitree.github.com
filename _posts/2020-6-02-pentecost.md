# Pentecost
```
Dead and gone are the aspirations of self
  a new career
  selfish desires
  a life of control
Born anew into a life of service and care-giving to 
  my God 
  my family
  the body of Christ
Grieving for this loss
  the time to adjust - incalculable - has begun 
Gratitude for all that I gain
  grace and peace
  a new life grunting and growing
  maturity and strength
  everlasting life and joy
A new spirit enters as 
  my soul given over to the incarnation
  acceptance over struggle
  trust over control
  satisfaction over anxiety
  generosity over accumulation
I am undone, and glad of it
```
