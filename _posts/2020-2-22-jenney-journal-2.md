I heard a crash from upstairs. I ran up to find Jenney naked on the floor of the bathroom. She had blacked out and fell on her way to the toilet. She'd been taking baths every so often as she found the water somewhat soothing, and wasn't bothering to put clothes back on since she just went back to bed. I urged her to go to the ER. She refused saying we had an appointment on Monday with the OB who could advise us better. She didn't want to go and have them charge us more money and say, "Take some Tylenol" again. But after that I watched her like a hawk and didn't let her go to the bathroom alone.
