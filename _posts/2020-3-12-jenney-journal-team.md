## Neurology

    <a href="https://www.chifranciscan.org/find-a-provider/details.physician.4c036de5-0ddc-4b0a-8586-5967723f4ed3.html?q=4c036de5-0ddc-4b0a-8586-5967723f4ed3">Marc A Goldman, MD</a><br/>
    Marc saved Jenney's life with the extraction of Jenney's tumor from her brain which was giving her severely debilitating migraines. Through his skill and care, she had a full recovery within 1.5 weeks!

## Maternal-Fetal Medicine

    <a href="https://www.multicare.org/doctors/tamara-tin-may-chao/">Tamara Tin-May Chao, MD</a><br/>

    Tamara is Jenney's OB who is in charge of our pregnancy, ensuring the safety of our unborn son, and may deliver him prematurely if the need arises.

## Oncology
<div class="phys-img" style="background-image: url('/img/SenecalFrank.jpg'); "></div>
[Frank M Senecal, MD, FACP](https://www.chifranciscan.org/find-a-provider/details.physician.8e02c210-37b7-400b-9ea9-939cbced5f97.html?q=8e02c210-37b7-400b-9ea9-939cbced5f97)

Frank is the main oncologist we've been seeing so far. He's clearly very respected by his peers and has put us in touch with other experienced experts. He's been an amazing source of strength, hope, and knowledge for Jenney and me.
