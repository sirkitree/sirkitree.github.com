The second release of DrupaLMAO's coverage of DrupalCon Boston 2008. Roger is the maintainer of the Asset module which I blogged about over at <a href="http://sirkitree.net/node/2">http://sirkitree.net</a> back in December so I was glad to get to meet him. Listen while Dave sits down to get a developer's perspective on DrupalCon.
