excerpt: "The meadow exists. Does not exist. Both. A deer trapped in a Corrupted Weave Zone experiences reality in quantum superposition."

*From the world of [Quantum Weave](/books/quantum-weave/), where magic is forgotten nanotechnology and failed spells leave reality fractured.*

The meadow exists. Does not exist. Both.

I stand in three places: beneath the silver birch where frost still clings to bark-wounds, at the stream's edge where mist rises in geometric spirals, and somewhere else—a meadow that *was* or *will be* or *refuses to decide*.

The others moved past this place long ago. I remember their hoofprints in snow that hasn't fallen. I remember their scent—musk and fear and the green tang of new grass—even though they never came this way. Even though they're here now, grazing just beyond the shimmer-line where reality forgets how to be singular.

I am always fleeing. I am always still.

When the wolf comes—and it comes, has come, is perpetually arriving through the thornwood—I blink. Not my eyes. *All of me*. The space where I stand folds, and I'm elsewhere: the same meadow, but the wolf is ten heartbeats behind, ten heartbeats ahead, circling something that isn't quite here.

It howls at all my positions. The sound fractures into harmonics that shouldn't exist.

My eyes see too much. The morning is blue-gold and verdant. The morning is iron-grey and dying. The morning is crystalline, geometric, a lattice of light that tastes of copper and distant thunder. I flick my ears toward the sound that hasn't arrived yet, the cracking branch that exists in probability only.

There is pain in the seeing. Four hundred paths fork from this moment—I graze, I bolt, I stand frozen, I dissolve into the shimmering *between*-space where the world can't decide what's real. I experience all of them, each layered over the others like frost on glass, each certain it's the only truth.

The grass I eat is fresh-bitter. Is rotted. Is crystalline fiber that cuts my tongue. Is not there at all.

I cannot leave. The boundary is exact—where the shimmer-line fades, where reality congeals into single-truth, I *hurt*. The solidity of elsewhere is poison. Here, in the fractured zone, in the space that can't make up its mind, I am home and exile both.

The wolf stops circling. Stares at me with eyes that split into prismatic shards. It's pack-hungry and alone-desperate and not-here-at-all. Its growl reverberates across the probability branches, and I know—in the way I know anything anymore—that it sees what I see. Multiple prey. Multiple futures. Multiple failures.

We are both trapped in the threshold.

I blink again. The wolf lunges at where I was-am-will-be. Its jaws snap on empty air full of snow that isn't falling. I stand three trees distant, watching it worry the nothing-space, whimpering at the taste of paradox.

Somewhere—somewhen—the others are safe. They reached the forest's edge where the world is kind enough to be singular. Where grass is only grass. Where hunger is only hunger. Where now is only *now*, and not this eternal, branching, recursive trap.

I lower my head to graze on probability.

The stars above wheel through their circuits, and I see them in daylight—pinpricks of light bleeding through the dome of reality where it's worn too thin. They hum. Everything hums here, a resonance just below hearing, just above forgetting.

I am not alone. There are others like me, scattered through the shimmer-zones—deer who stood too long where the world breaks. I see their afterimages, their echo-selves, trails of translucent bodies stretching across might-be meadows. We don't touch. Can't touch. Each of us is our own probability collapse, our own uncertain truth.

The sun sets. The sun rises. The sun holds its position at zenith, burning through three seasons at once.

I flicker.

I remain.

The threshold keeps me, and I keep the threshold, and neither of us knows anymore where the boundary lies between observer and observed, between what fractures and what's already broken.

The meadow exists.

I exist within it.

Both statements are true, false, and something syntax cannot capture.

The wolf circles.

I am always fleeing.

I am always here.

*In the world of Quantum Weave, when spells fail catastrophically, they create Corrupted Weave Zones—places where the quantum electromagnetic field can't decide on a single state of reality. This phase deer is trapped in perpetual superposition, experiencing all possible states simultaneously. It exists between. Forever.*
