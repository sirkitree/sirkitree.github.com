April was a blessed month. I've described it as the eye of the storm; peaceful and calm for us, yet with a storm wall on either side. The second wall is about to hit, yet during this time we've been able to recharge our batteries, to concentrate on those things that matter most; our family and our faith. God is with us, and no matter the outcome, all things work for good to those who love God.

> And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. &mdash; Romans 8:28

The time He's given us together to rest, to recover from and process the trauma of past recent events has been so appreciated. We've continued to receive gifts, prayers, letters of encouragement and love from so many people. We've continued to pray and to read the Word of God. And it has all been comforting. April has been a blessed month of peace... He leads me beside still waters...

Marcus comes on Monday. Our recent appointments have only indicated good things and so everything is going according to the plan of the doctors, and we pray that God's plan aligns. He's continued to heal Jenney and we thank him daily as we pray with the kids, and we ask him to give Marcus the strength he needs to come into the world. Marcus could still be in the NICU for a couple of weeks, but as long as he can eat, breath, and retain body heat on his own, we should be able to bring him home to meet his brothers, sister, and grandmother.

Jeanne (Jenney's mother) has also come up to help us during this time. She has a wonderful friend who drove her door to door from San Diego to our house in 18 hours on Wednesday so that she could be with us and not have to take an airplane. God bless her.

I've continued to have work, and on Monday I'm blessed enough to be able to start 6 weeks of paternity leave. My co-workers had a surprise send off for me when they bombed one of my typical zoom calls of the day :D It was very sweet, and made me feel loved. Thanks to all of them I know I leave my work project in good hands as I focus these coming weeks on my family.

Tomorrow will be a day of prayer for me as I pray for the operation on Monday to go well, attend various churches services online, and have Sunday school with the kids. We'll be reading Daniel in the lion's den from "The Jesus Storybook Bible" and I hope to impress upon them the importance of prayer, and of being steadfast in our faith.

I'm sure I'll be writing more in the coming weeks and letting everyone know how things are going with Jenney and Marcus. For now I'll leave you with my favorite song of late.
