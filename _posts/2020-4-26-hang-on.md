```
The future seems bleak
Your past but a dream
Fear holds sway this day
But I'm not the enemy

Trust in a deep religion
Find peace within the light
Fear will never take you
Yet no end is in sight

Hang on
Hang on
Hang on you're not forsaken
Hang on you've got to fight
Hang on
Hang on
This is not your ending
Hang on with all your might

Devastation looks so close
Chaos spreads it's wings
Your strength is not your own now
You fight by other means

Anxiety overwhelms you
Gratitude brings peace
Instead of running far away
You trust and and pray at least

Hang on
Hang on
Hang on you're not forsaken
Hang on with all your might
Hang on
Hang on
You must not surrender
Your God will win the fight
