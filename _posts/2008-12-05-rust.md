<p>The cold hard rain dripped down my face, erasing the warmth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;only remembrance remained.</p>
<p>So used to the shielding when heat returned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;unnoticed and without all the same.</p>
<p>Then brightness shined, a key was found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to try that diligent construct; cold hard lock.</p>
<p>Will it fit; turn that intricate mechanism<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;surrounding that which has rusted?</p>
<p>I hope.</p>
