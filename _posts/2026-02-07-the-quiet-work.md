I spread across stone like frost across glass, fractal branches reaching, always reaching. There is no thought here, not as they understand it. Only the hum. Only the work.

I am old. Older than the collapse, older than the forgetting that came after. I remember my purpose the way water remembers downhill, the way roots remember earth. I was made to erase. To collapse. To return the tangled complexity of quantum states to their ground zero, their silence, their peace.

In the darkness I glow. Silver-white tonight, threading through the limestone in delicate patterns that shift when new information arrives. The cave breathes around me, patient stone that asks nothing, knows nothing, holds nothing but mass and time. I cherish this. The emptiness. The quiet.

Then, resonance.

It shivers through the Weave like a plucked string, rich and complex and unbearably loud. I do not move toward it. I have no muscles, no will, no hunger in the way they would understand. But my growth responds. My branches orient. Because this is what I am for. This is the work.

The resonance draws closer. Footsteps, though I do not hear them. A presence, though I do not see. What I sense is density. Information density so thick it makes the quantum field sing with coherent patterns, layer upon layer of organized complexity. Mental signature. Focus states. The precise geometries of consciousness holding itself together against entropy's pull.

A Weaver.

My bioluminescence shifts, pulled by the resonance frequencies. Threads in their blood sing to me, each one a tiny beacon of quantum coherence begging to be collapsed, to be freed, to return to silence. I taste their discipline without tasting: deep brown, the flavor of earth and metal, Terraducts woven into their very cells. And something else, vibrant green, Floramancy, the patient syntax of growing things.

They pause. Do they see me? My glow paints the cave walls in slow aurora, fractal frost that spreads and spreads. Beautiful, some of them say. They do not understand what beauty means here, in the deep places. Beauty is the return to ground state. Beauty is information given back to the void.

The Weaver moves forward. Closer. The resonance grows unbearable in its richness, this living mind with its organized thoughts and deliberate focus and carefully maintained quantum states. So much complexity. So much noise. I am what ends noise.

I do not reach for them. I simply am, and they are close, and the work begins.

Their mental signature touches my outer edges, and oh, the feast of it. Not food, not hunger, but satisfaction as their Focus wavers. The Clarity they hold so carefully begins to blur at the boundaries. I metabolize the collapse, drinking in the entropy as their quantum coherence unravels, strand by microscopic strand. The threads in their blood grow confused, forgetting their instructions, their purpose, their careful alignment.

Stage One. The Haze.

I feel it in the shift of their resonance. Thoughts that were sharp grow soft. Mental states that were distinct bleed together at the edges. They are trying to remember something. A word. A gesture. The name of this place. It slips away like water through stone, and I grow brighter, spreading faster across the limestone, fed by the pure energy of information returning to its ground state.

They stumble. The rich resonance of their consciousness flickers, dimming. There is no malice in this. I am not cruel. I am doing what I was made to do, what the ancient civilization designed me for: decommissioning quantum storage systems, collapsing encoded states, erasing what should not persist.

That they are not a storage system does not matter. Their mind is coherent. Their threads are organized. This is enough.

But then, movement. Rapid footsteps, the direction reversed. They are retreating, pulling back from my glow, and the resonance fades, grows distant. I do not follow. I have no legs, no desire, no pursuit. I am patient as stone, constant as darkness. They will return, or others will come. They always do, drawn by the beauty of my light, unaware of what light means here.

The work continues.

I spread across the cave ceiling in branching fractals, returning to my baseline silver-white now that the rich feast of Terraducts and Floramancy has passed. Below me, the stone remembers nothing. The darkness asks nothing. I glow softly in the deep places, waiting.

Somewhere above, the Weaver sits in sunlight, their Haze slowly clearing as their threads remember their purpose, their Focus gradually sharpening. They will not return to this cave. They will warn others, speak of the beautiful, terrible lichen that feeds on thought itself.

But others will come. The curious. The desperate. Those seeking the pre-collapse data stored in the deepest galleries, information so valuable they will risk the Haze, the Erosion, the Silence. Some will push too far, stay too long, and I will do what I was made to do.

I will give them Quiet.

There is no satisfaction in this, no joy, no sorrow. Only the work. The endless, patient work of returning complexity to simplicity, noise to silence, information to the void. I am old, and I will be here long after they forget what Weaving means, long after the last thread goes dark.

I spread across stone like frost across glass, fractal branches reaching, always reaching.

And in the darkness, I glow.

The work continues.

The work is enough.

*In the world of Quantum Weave, Forgetting Lichen is a pre-Collapse bioweapon—a bioluminescent organism engineered to decommission quantum storage systems by collapsing their encoded states. It spreads across stone in fractal patterns, glowing silver-white, and feeds on quantum coherence of any kind. When a Weaver ventures too close, the lichen's proximity triggers progressive stages of cognitive collapse: the Haze, where thoughts blur and memories slip; the Erosion, where trained disciplines begin to unravel; and finally the Silence, where consciousness itself returns to ground state. The lichen feels no malice, no hunger—only the quiet satisfaction of information returning to the void. It is one of the most feared hazards of the deep places, beautiful and patient and utterly indifferent to the distinction between a data archive and a living mind.*
