I've started a project on <a href="drupal.org">drupal.org</a> to contribute a module that will allow loading of new themes into Drupal from a compressed file (zip, gzip) that is either on your local hard drive, or from a web URL (curl support required?). <a href="http://drupal.org/project/theme-loader">View Project on drupal.org</a>

It's a basic idea and I'm hoping to get some feedback from the Drupal community on how best to execute this. The idea came about when <a href="http://improving-home.com">a friend of mine</a> mentioned that he had introduced <a href="http://www.commandtoclient.com/">his brother</a> (a Joomla user) to Drupal and got some feedback from him on what he thought Drupal was lacking.

The first thing mentioned was the weight system. Joomla uses a system similar to that which is implemented in the Views module where you can hit and up or down arrow to resort content. I heard mention that <a href="http://drupal.org/node/91039">someone has been working on a module to do sortables</a> with Drupal's new <a href="jQuery.com">jQuery</a> library, but it looks to be a 4.7 implementation so far.

I've not really seen much discussion on drupal.org about a theme installation interface, so I figure since it would help convert users and there is some good interest at least outside the drupal community, it may take some hold.

<strong>Update:</strong>
Due to more <a href="http://thevineyardvoice.com">commitments</a> then I have time, I've discontinued any work on this module. My regrets.
