    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Swept away are the remnants of old, smaller dreams thought too impossible now become reality, even though torn<br/>
Reality torn asunder, pulling back the curtain to reveal the secrets of life lived fully, unhindered by shame<br/>
Shameful regrets, swept away, replaced by a new reality, revealed through conscious will and positive karmic energy<br/>
Positive energies flow through willful projections when unhindered by fear, guided by respect and discipline<br/>
Respect being key, replaces that which eats at everyones soul of late, fear and the assumption of security, apathy</br></p>

<br/>


<p>Swept away and free to dream, your life becomes clay in which to mold a destiny, in harmony with the lines which exist<br/>
See the lines, look ahead down that path which your decision may take you to make a wise choice... prosper<br/>
Fear and doubt be swept away, leaving assured security molded by discipline and experience, always increasing, improving<br/>
Constant reshaping of thoughts and patterns of reasoning, learning to optimize, conceptualize, visualize<br/>
Look forward to what is to come, and what will be swept away</p>
