    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>```
Angel of fire, wings of light
  Visit me in my dreams tonight
  Tell me of love and burning desire
  Caress my lips, set me on fire</p>

<p>Angel of fire, eyes so bright
  See through my soul, feel the fright
  Singe my heart and look for the liar
  Scar on my sould cleanse with your fire
  Transcendance lost on the blackening shame
  Licked by lips that are black from the flame</p>

<p>Angel of fire, cleanse me just right
  Leaving your mark steal through the night
  Tease my mind leaving desire
  Tease my heart scarred by your fire
  Knowing we'll never ever be the same
  Learn from our past, never do this again
```

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These are from high school. Guess you'd call that about the height of my creativity - or at least when I had the time to do all of this instead of worrying about a paycheck.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These are also all pretty old and come from the angst and passions of a teenager. I've grow less intense, it seems, over the years as I don't seem to have the knack of this anymore - if ever I really did. Some of it I still find pretty fun, though it's a bit harder to appreciate in a digital medium since part of what made these so interesting was in the way I wrote them. Strange spacings, capitalization's, and pictographs along with the structure were all part of my art form.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The cold hard rain dripped down my face, erasing the warmth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;only remembrance remained.</p>


<p>So used to the shielding when heat returned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;unnoticed and without all the same.</p>


<p>Then brightness shined, a key was found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to try that diligent construct; cold hard lock.</p>


<p>Will it fit; turn that intricate mechanism<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;surrounding that which has rusted?</p>


<p>I hope.</p>
