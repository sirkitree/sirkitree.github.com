    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://sirkitree.github.com/files/chris_tattoo.jpg" style="width:250px; height: 188px; float:right;" /> Christopher just got his tattoo and as you can see it's almost exactly like Cody's. So I'll be getting mine as soon as I get some time and I'm going to keep the design as close to theirs as possible.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://jeradbitner.com/files/cody_tattoo.jpg" style="float:left; width: 223px; height: 220px; margin-right:10px;" /> Here's Cody's tattoo. I'm going to schedule mine sometime this week, and Chris has his scheduled for next Saturday. I've also attached the original that Cody based his off of.</p>

<p>From left to right, top to bottom, those are my initials, Bryant's initials, my Dad's initials in the center, Cody's initials, and Chris's initials.</p>

<p>We had all planned on getting this tattoo together with our Dad, but he died before we ever got a chance to do so. If you ever have a chance to do something like this with your father, don't wait. Do it as soon as possible. You will not regret it.</p>
