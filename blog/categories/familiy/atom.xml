    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So my brothers and I have wanted to get a tattoo for a while now that is in remembrance of our father who died one month ago today. Here is a preliminary sketch I did in Illustrator. We're going to have this the basis of the tattoo and have the artist get more creative with it, personalize each one.</p>

<p>I want mine to have better knots in it... I'm not very good at designing Celtic knots. The initials probably a little bigger ... maybe just my dad's initials bigger. Anyway, I know mine is going on my left arm as a shield because my dad was left handed. It's also where the cancer attacked him.</p>

<p>But I'll be sure to post pics of all of our tattoos once we get them.</p>
