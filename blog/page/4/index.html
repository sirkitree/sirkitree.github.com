  <div class="entry-content"><p>So it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve posted, and there has been so much going on in my life. I&#8217;ve moved to New York City to work with Sony BMG making websites for rockstars. I gotta say, it&#8217;s been a HUGE change for me. My calm, collected country life where I lived all alone in the woods with the ability to go camping in my back yard was replaced by the hustle and bustle of New York City, staying in a studio apartment next to the Empire State building.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been searching for an apartment, and there are lots available, but nothing seems to be what I really want and everything is just so expensive. There is one in Hoboken I&#8217;m going to be looking at this week and hopefully that will be it, but there is another one close to Hoboken, next to Washington Park, that Dave and I looked at today that was perfect. It&#8217;s a little more expensive and there is a brokers fee so I may have to borrow from family to get into the place. I really don&#8217;t want to do that, and would rather have the place in Hoboken so that I can feel like I&#8217;m doing it all on my own, but then my bank account still hasn&#8217;t received my first paycheck from Sony and I&#8217;m worried that they haven&#8217;t setup my direct deposit yet. That means they&#8217;ve mailed my check and I won&#8217;t get it until Monday or Tuesday, then I have to get it deposited into my account back home. Only after that will i be able to setup the rent.com escrow account in order to get the keys form the guy who owns the place in Hoboken. He&#8217;s living in Athens Greece, so we have to do it this way. So as you can imagine, with only 9 days or so to get moved and into a place, I&#8217;m stressing.</p>

<p>However, there are a few other possibilities, like Dave getting the same benefits as myself and hanging with him wherever Sony puts him, but that&#8217;s not going to happen before I have to get out of the place I&#8217;m at now. So I guess I&#8217;m really banking on this place in Hoboken&#8230; ah stress&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was working on a select all feature today and just wanted to share this with the world. (a.k.a. keep it for later)</p>

<pre>
$(document).ready( function() {
  $('a#select_all').click( function() {
    $('input:checkbox').each( function() {
      this.checked = !this.checked;
    });
    return false;
  });
});
</pre>


<p>The first item to note is that jQuery created pseudo classes for input.</p>

<pre>
$('input:checkbox');
...
$('input:textbox');
... etc.
</pre>


<p>The second item to note, which I thought was ingenious, was setting the value of the checkbox to the inverse of it&#8217;s current value.</p>

<pre>
this.checked = !this.checked;
</pre>


<p>Works great and it&#8217;s short and sweet. Who loves jQuery?</p>

<time datetime="2007-03-07T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 7<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had a friend ask me how to be able to give CCK fields more user-friendly class names so that they could be styled a little easier. I actually needed to do this myself with a project at work, so I had time to really sit down and figure out a good way to do this.</p>

<h3>CCK</h3>


<p>The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">Content Creation Kit (CCK)</a> is a great way to add different fields to any particular content type within Drupal. When you first start learning Drupal, you&#8217;ll see that it ships with two main content types: Page and Story. The fields that these two content types have by default are the Title and the Body. These are respectively a single line text field, and a multi-line text field of which you can choose an input format. This is great and very useful for basic content, but what if I would like another text field other then just Title and Body? CCK allows you to add this. But instead of trying to explain the power and awe of CCK here, please take a look at the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/101723">CCK handbook</a> where this is explained in much greater detail.</p>

<h3>Stepping Stones</h3>


<p>Now adding CCK fields to a content type is all fine and dandy, but what if I want to make them <em>look</em> better by perhaps changing around the order in which they appear when viewed, or perhaps target that specific element with my CSS in order to specify the exact look and feel of the content it holds? This is where you want to start theming. However, sometimes theming in Drupal can be a pretty complex concept to grok at first. Not because it is very hard, but because without any stepping stones to how theming actually works, you can very easily fall into a dangerous quagmire of code, arrays and objects that you have no idea are even available to you.</p>

<h3>Contemplate this my friend</h3>


<p>This is where <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/about/jeffrobbins">Jeff Robbins</a> of the <a href="http://www.lullabot.com">Lullabot</a> crew has come to our rescue with a great module called <a href="http://drupal.org/project/contemplate">Content Templates (contemplate)</a>. I believe this module is an incredible stepping stone in learning how to bridge the gap that exists between CCK and the way CCK fields are presented (themed). Installing this module will add a new menu item under Content Mangement in your Administration panel called &#8216;Content templates&#8217;, and also a templates tab inside of your &#8216;Content types&#8217; page of your Admin section. Once you create a template for any given content type, you can effectually customize the look and feel of not just the content type&#8217;s node view (labeled Body in contemplate), but also the Teaser and the RSS!</p>

<h3>Commercial break</h3>


<p>BUT WAIT, THERE&#8217;S MORE! Each fieldset (teaser, body, and rss) has not just a text field to edit the template in, but also inserts a default view of what Drupal spits out, ready to edit. And if that isn&#8217;t exciting enough for you, there is (<strong>IMHO the most useful feature of this module</strong>) a rich text-field next to that which lists every object available to you for templating! There&#8217;s even some neato javascript that allows you to click on an object and insert the php to print that object into the template field. This is just good stuff man. Fun times. Act now while supplies last. Void where prohibited.</p>

<h3>Ok, time for a downer</h3>


<p>Finding such a gem is really very great, but the excitement starts to wear off after about an hour of trying to template a complete content type inside of that teeny, tiny, little box. Even the javascript insertion of the box next to it begins to feel like a sticky piece of candy that&#8217;s lost it&#8217;s flavor. I&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to mention that the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/devel">devel module</a> provides you with a feature quite similar to this little javascript flavored object reference box, but unless you&#8217;re already very familiar with how to work with these field objects in PHP, the devel module is next to useless. So, again as a stepping stone, the contemplate module really comes in handy for referencing what objects are available to theme, and will give you a little insight as to how to work with them in PHP.</p>

<p>So what do we do about the teeny, tiny, little text box that we&#8217;re supposed to put all of our theming code into? Well, fortunately Drupal&#8217;s main theming engine, phptemplate, has already taken care of this. Listen carefully now, &#8216;cuz this is important and I don&#8217;t want to lose you now. We&#8217;ve already come so far. <strong>Each content type can have it&#8217;s very own template file within your theme.</strong></p>

<h3>Theming a content type</h3>


<p>You can actually accomplish this very easily. The first step is to create a file within your theme directory named <strong>node-content_type.tpl.php</strong> <em>replacing <strong>content_type</strong> with the machine readable name you&#8217;ve given your content type</em>. So if your content type is named <strong>forum</strong>, you&#8217;ll want the file to be named node-<strong>forum</strong>.tpl.php. For almost all of my work lately I&#8217;ve been using a <a href="http://drupal.org/project/zen">theme called zen</a>. It&#8217;s written by the Lullabot crew once again, and is probably the best theme out there to teach you anything about a theme. This theme has a file that is a custom themed content type already specific to the forum module. The file is node-forum.tpl.php. I&#8217;ve used this on multiple occasions as a template on how to start a new custom theme file for a content type. If you use this file, you&#8217;ll notice that, among other things, it prints out the $content variable. All of our CCK fields can be found inside of this variable, along with the default theming of them that you find in the contemplate module&#8217;s teeny, tiny, little box for the template code. So you can take the code that is generated by default in the contemplate module, and insert all of that where you see the $content variable being printed in the tpl file. From there, you can do all of your editing in the editor of your choice without having to strain your back trying to bend closer to your monitor to see what&#8217;s inside of the teeny, tiny, little box.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following my <a href="/rolechanger/">recent post</a> on my <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rolechanger/">rolechanger module</a>, I started delving into how to provide functionality with the resulting dropdown box that the module provides. I wanted to provide all functionality through javascript and have included a rolechanger.js file for this purpose. However I found a few quirks while working with jQuery and the select element.</p>

<p>I started out with a .change() on the select element and drilled down through the .children() looking for [@selected]. However, thought this worked fine in IE, Firefox did not pick this up at all. I saw in the jQuery issues that this had been fixed, but evidently not for the release that ships with Drupal. Here&#8217;s the resulting code for the IE portion:</p>

<pre>
    // ie doesn't pick up the option.click, so we'll have to use the select.change
    $('#edit-role-changer').change(function(){

    // get rid of select box
    $('#edit-role-changer').hide();

        // show the chosen role as static text
       // NOTE: FF doesn't pick up [@selected]
      $('#role').html($(this).children("[@selected]").text()).show();

      // provide a change link
      $('#role-change-back').show();

    });
</pre>


<p>Firefox was actually a little easier to code for, since I found that it would pick up a .click() on the option element. So the resulting code for Firefox is this:</p>

<pre>
    // provide action for an option change
    $('#edit-role-changer option').click(function(){

      // get rid of select box
      $('#edit-role-changer').hide();

      // show the chosen role as static text
      $('#role').html($(this).text()).show();

      // provide a change link
      $('#role-change-back').show();

    });
</pre>


<p>Since Firefox does pick up the .change() function that is on the select element that is used for IE, I then had to do a browsers detection, which jQuery makes simple as pie with $.browser. Here is the resulting full code:</p>

<pre>
  // see which browser we're working with
  if ($.browser.msie) {

    // ie doesn't pick up the option.click, so we'll have to use the select.change
    $('#edit-role-changer').change(function(){

      // get rid of select box
      $('#edit-role-changer').hide();

      // show the chosen role as static text
      // NOTE: FF doesn't pick up [@selected]
      $('#role').html($(this).children("[@selected]").text()).show();

      // provide a change link
      $('#role-change-back').show();

    });
  }
  else {

    // provide action for an option change
    $('#edit-role-changer option').click(function(){

      // get rid of select box
      $('#edit-role-changer').hide();

      // show the chosen role as static text
      $('#role').html($(this).text()).show();

      // provide a change link
      $('#role-change-back').show();

    });
  }
</pre>


<p>Happy jQuerying!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So my first commit to the Drupal contributions has been made! WooHoo! I partied hard that night :) No, it&#8217;s really not that big of a deal, but I&#8217;m excited as it takes me one step further into Drupal development and being more involved in the Drupal community.</p>

<p>The module is called <a href="http://drupal.org/projects/rolechanger">rolechanger</a>, and came about when there was a need on a new site I&#8217;m building for work that needs to have a menu&#8217;s links change based upon a chosen role. The roles are created in the main Drupal interface and then you tell rolechanger which roles from that list you would like your users to be able to choose from. Nothing really happens once one of those roles is chosen, at least from a traditional programmatic standpoint since I&#8217;ll be using javascript for the functionality of changing the menu items. The module is somewhat limited in this respect, but I&#8217;ve included a rolechanger.js file in the module&#8217;s directory for this purpose and anyone can edit this to define what happens on change using drupal&#8217;s built in jQuery library. It&#8217;s really more of a widget I suppose, developed for a specific purpose and probably will not have a whole lot of use to anyone other then my current project, but I contributed it anyway just for the purpose of doing so and gaining the experience of committing code through CVS to Drupal&#8217;s repository. Hey, you gotta start somewhere right?</p>

<p>Update: <a href="http://jeradbitner.com/node/16">Also, see my post on using some jQuery code with this module.</a></p>

<p>So Marti Gras weekend was great! I&#8217;m so fraking sore form Wii that it&#8217;s not even funny. Well maybe a little bit funny&#8230; Snugs and his wife were in town as well as Dave, so we all hung out at Dana&#8217;s, drank, and played Wii for 8 hours straight! It was a blast, a good time was had by all. This video is of Dave and Dana boxing, but we bowled a hell of a lot more. We almost all hit pro by the end of the night (3am). Too bad for Amy, who hurt her leg earlier in the day and was not able to bowl very much, but she did pretty well sitting down, even on her Vikoden! We also played with my Mac&#8217;s PhotoBooth program, hilarity ensued. <object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/gYuacuTK_eU"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/gYuacuTK_eU" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve started a project on <a href="drupal.org">drupal.org</a> to contribute a module that will allow loading of new themes into Drupal from a compressed file (zip, gzip) that is either on your local hard drive, or from a web URL (curl support required?). <a href="http://drupal.org/project/theme-loader">View Project on drupal.org</a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s a basic idea and I&#8217;m hoping to get some feedback from the Drupal community on how best to execute this. The idea came about when <a href="http://improving-home.com">a friend of mine</a> mentioned that he had introduced <a href="http://www.commandtoclient.com/">his brother</a> (a Joomla user) to Drupal and got some feedback from him on what he thought Drupal was lacking.</p>

<p>The first thing mentioned was the weight system. Joomla uses a system similar to that which is implemented in the Views module where you can hit and up or down arrow to resort content. I heard mention that <a href="http://drupal.org/node/91039">someone has been working on a module to do sortables</a> with Drupal&#8217;s new <a href="jQuery.com">jQuery</a> library, but it looks to be a 4.7 implementation so far.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve not really seen much discussion on drupal.org about a theme installation interface, so I figure since it would help convert users and there is some good interest at least outside the drupal community, it may take some hold.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
Due to more <a href="http://thevineyardvoice.com">commitments</a> then I have time, I&#8217;ve discontinued any work on this module. My regrets.</p>

<h3>The family side</h3>


<p>I spent the week of January 15th in Providence, RI with a group known as <a href='http://www.lullabot.com'>Lullabot</a> learning the ins and outs of <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>. I&#8217;ve been working with Drupal for a while now, about 2 years in fact, and had learned quite a lot on my own by reading the <a href="http://www.drupal.org/handbook">Drupal Handbook</a> and hacking the core (which really is a no-no, but a great way to learn). When my buddy <a href='http://thethisorthat.com'>Dave</a> told me about the workshop Lullabot was having, I looked into it and convinced <a href="http://www.improving-home.com">Shawn</a> to get <a href='http://www.c-sgroup.com'>work</a> to pay for it and let me go for the whole week. Since my <a href='http://www.rewardamericaclub.com'>Aunt and Uncle</a> live near Providence, I asked them if I could stay with them and it just so happened that the week was filled with birthdays! Two of my cousins and my Uncle&#8217;s birthdays were that week. What luck! Carmen and Frank were more then happy to have me up for a week and I was so glad to get to spend some time with them. I lived with them for a summer when I was 17 and I&#8217;ve missed them ever since.</p>

<h3>The technical side</h3>


<p>The Lullabot workshops, however were the real reason for the trip (since work was sending me) and I was not disappointed in that fact at all. They were fantastic! I knew quite a bit about Drupal when I arrived, but soon learned how much I really didn&#8217;t know. I like to compare it to a huge puzzle that I had been putting together all by myself, not really knowing where all the pieces went, but I was getting them together on my own yet out of order. These workshops really helped to put the pieces I was missing into place and really helped fill out the whole picture. I learned in that one week what I had been missing and felt as though I crammed two months of learning on my own, into one week. My brain was soaking up the information like a sponge and <strong>it felt great</strong>! I wanted more and by the end of the week I felt like crying, knowing that I would have to leave and would not be able to maintain the rate of information absorption I was getting. I felt inspired, awed, and humbled by the amount of knowledge the Lullabots bestowed upon us, knowing that there was even more that could just not be taught with the time that we had. My only real consolation in that, was the fact that Drupal is open source and these were the people that had put enough time and effort into the creation of Drupal that they actually felt like they had an ownership in it. Maybe ownership si not the right word, but more like the feeling a parent might have towards a child, a very bright, intelligent, and well liked child. And with that realization, came the revelation that I too could have that as well! But it would take much time, effort and learning before that could ever be me. Now, I&#8217;m not one for New Years resolutions, and yes I know it&#8217;s already the end of January, but I submit to you now my New Years Revolution: I will contribute to the Drupal community as much as possible this coming year and will hopefully find that piece of mind in knowing that I&#8217;ve contributed to the greater good in a project that affects so many geeks lives. And I say geek with the utmost admiration and respect, because not only do I categorize myself as one, but because so many of the people I&#8217;ve come to respect categorize themselves as one as well.</p>
