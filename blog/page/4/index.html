  <div class="entry-content"><p>I make cool stuff at work. I learn something every day that makes me excited and in awe that I get paid to learn, and use, while being taught by the most <a href="http://lullabot.com">enigmatic geniuses</a> that I could even call friend, after a month or so of work comradere. Darkness turns to light with the slightest of gestures from the hands of such as these, that one might stop&#8230; and wonders how they, <em>themselves</em> could become something of such magnitude&#8230; if only they try, learn, know and then teach.</p>

<h3>Try, Learn, Know and then Teach.</h3>


<p>I am a Drupal Developer, and I love my job. And though it&#8217;s good to be paid to do what I do, so that I might live in our world, and survive, it is so much more rewarding to live by a Basic Standard in a community of individuals that live by a basic oath, simple, plain, and yet oh&#8230; so full of meaning. <em>Try, Learn, Know, and then Teach</em>. A creed of this simplicity and magnitude has yet to be developed and aspired to, other then by so many as those that see Open Source as a way of life, a desire, and a monologue to happiness. The principles not only can be seen, and used well, within software development, but of your life in general. An that is what intrigued me the most when I found Drupal.</p>

<h4>Come again?</h4>


<p>I know it sounds somewhat fanatical and naive, but if you think back to your <a href="http://www.peace.ca/kindergarten.htm">kindergarten rules</a>, what is there NOT in Drupal&#8217;s Open Source Way of Life that could not be applied to a life and how it should be lived? Drupal&#8217;s success has been attribute to that and succinctly profound. So live on Open Source, live on&#8230; those that thought up Open Source, and please, participate and become someone you respect in a community that truly appreciates those that try, learn, know and then teach.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve posted, and there has been so much going on in my life. I&#8217;ve moved to New York City to work with Sony BMG making websites for rockstars. I gotta say, it&#8217;s been a HUGE change for me. My calm, collected country life where I lived all alone in the woods with the ability to go camping in my back yard was replaced by the hustle and bustle of New York City, staying in a studio apartment next to the Empire State building.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been searching for an apartment, and there are lots available, but nothing seems to be what I really want and everything is just so expensive. There is one in Hoboken I&#8217;m going to be looking at this week and hopefully that will be it, but there is another one close to Hoboken, next to Washington Park, that Dave and I looked at today that was perfect. It&#8217;s a little more expensive and there is a brokers fee so I may have to borrow from family to get into the place. I really don&#8217;t want to do that, and would rather have the place in Hoboken so that I can feel like I&#8217;m doing it all on my own, but then my bank account still hasn&#8217;t received my first paycheck from Sony and I&#8217;m worried that they haven&#8217;t setup my direct deposit yet. That means they&#8217;ve mailed my check and I won&#8217;t get it until Monday or Tuesday, then I have to get it deposited into my account back home. Only after that will i be able to setup the rent.com escrow account in order to get the keys form the guy who owns the place in Hoboken. He&#8217;s living in Athens Greece, so we have to do it this way. So as you can imagine, with only 9 days or so to get moved and into a place, I&#8217;m stressing.</p>

<p>However, there are a few other possibilities, like Dave getting the same benefits as myself and hanging with him wherever Sony puts him, but that&#8217;s not going to happen before I have to get out of the place I&#8217;m at now. So I guess I&#8217;m really banking on this place in Hoboken&#8230; ah stress&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was working on a select all feature today and just wanted to share this with the world. (a.k.a. keep it for later)</p>

<p><code>
$(document).ready( function() {
  $('a#select_all').click( function() {</p>

<pre><code>$('input:checkbox').each( function() {
  this.checked = !this.checked;
});
return false;
</code></pre>

<p>  });
});
</code></p>

<p>The first item to note is that jQuery created pseudo classes for input.
<code>
$('input:checkbox');
...
$('input:textbox');
... etc.
</code></p>

<p>The second item to note, which I thought was ingenious, was setting the value of the checkbox to the inverse of it&#8217;s current value.
<code>
this.checked = !this.checked;
</code></p>

<p>Works great and it&#8217;s short and sweet. Who loves jQuery?</p>

<time datetime="2007-03-07T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 7<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had a friend ask me how to be able to give CCK fields more user-friendly class names so that they could be styled a little easier. I actually needed to do this myself with a project at work, so I had time to really sit down and figure out a good way to do this.</p>

<h3>CCK</h3>


<p>The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">Content Creation Kit (CCK)</a> is a great way to add different fields to any particular content type within Drupal. When you first start learning Drupal, you&#8217;ll see that it ships with two main content types: Page and Story. The fields that these two content types have by default are the Title and the Body. These are respectively a single line text field, and a multi-line text field of which you can choose an input format. This is great and very useful for basic content, but what if I would like another text field other then just Title and Body? CCK allows you to add this. But instead of trying to explain the power and awe of CCK here, please take a look at the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/101723">CCK handbook</a> where this is explained in much greater detail.</p>

<h3>Stepping Stones</h3>


<p>Now adding CCK fields to a content type is all fine and dandy, but what if I want to make them <em>look</em> better by perhaps changing around the order in which they appear when viewed, or perhaps target that specific element with my CSS in order to specify the exact look and feel of the content it holds? This is where you want to start theming. However, sometimes theming in Drupal can be a pretty complex concept to grok at first. Not because it is very hard, but because without any stepping stones to how theming actually works, you can very easily fall into a dangerous quagmire of code, arrays and objects that you have no idea are even available to you.</p>

<h3>Contemplate this my friend</h3>


<p>This is where <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/about/jeffrobbins">Jeff Robbins</a> of the <a href="http://www.lullabot.com">Lullabot</a> crew has come to our rescue with a great module called <a href="http://drupal.org/project/contemplate">Content Templates (contemplate)</a>. I believe this module is an incredible stepping stone in learning how to bridge the gap that exists between CCK and the way CCK fields are presented (themed). Installing this module will add a new menu item under Content Mangement in your Administration panel called &#8216;Content templates&#8217;, and also a templates tab inside of your &#8216;Content types&#8217; page of your Admin section. Once you create a template for any given content type, you can effectually customize the look and feel of not just the content type&#8217;s node view (labeled Body in contemplate), but also the Teaser and the RSS!</p>

<h3>Commercial break</h3>


<p>BUT WAIT, THERE&#8217;S MORE! Each fieldset (teaser, body, and rss) has not just a text field to edit the template in, but also inserts a default view of what Drupal spits out, ready to edit. And if that isn&#8217;t exciting enough for you, there is (<strong>IMHO the most useful feature of this module</strong>) a rich text-field next to that which lists every object available to you for templating! There&#8217;s even some neato javascript that allows you to click on an object and insert the php to print that object into the template field. This is just good stuff man. Fun times. Act now while supplies last. Void where prohibited.</p>

<h3>Ok, time for a downer</h3>


<p>Finding such a gem is really very great, but the excitement starts to wear off after about an hour of trying to template a complete content type inside of that teeny, tiny, little box. Even the javascript insertion of the box next to it begins to feel like a sticky piece of candy that&#8217;s lost it&#8217;s flavor. I&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to mention that the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/devel">devel module</a> provides you with a feature quite similar to this little javascript flavored object reference box, but unless you&#8217;re already very familiar with how to work with these field objects in PHP, the devel module is next to useless. So, again as a stepping stone, the contemplate module really comes in handy for referencing what objects are available to theme, and will give you a little insight as to how to work with them in PHP.</p>

<p>So what do we do about the teeny, tiny, little text box that we&#8217;re supposed to put all of our theming code into? Well, fortunately Drupal&#8217;s main theming engine, phptemplate, has already taken care of this. Listen carefully now, &#8216;cuz this is important and I don&#8217;t want to lose you now. We&#8217;ve already come so far. <strong>Each content type can have it&#8217;s very own template file within your theme.</strong></p>

<h3>Theming a content type</h3>


<p>You can actually accomplish this very easily. The first step is to create a file within your theme directory named <strong>node-content_type.tpl.php</strong> <em>replacing <strong>content_type</strong> with the machine readable name you&#8217;ve given your content type</em>. So if your content type is named <strong>forum</strong>, you&#8217;ll want the file to be named node-<strong>forum</strong>.tpl.php. For almost all of my work lately I&#8217;ve been using a <a href="http://drupal.org/project/zen">theme called zen</a>. It&#8217;s written by the Lullabot crew once again, and is probably the best theme out there to teach you anything about a theme. This theme has a file that is a custom themed content type already specific to the forum module. The file is node-forum.tpl.php. I&#8217;ve used this on multiple occasions as a template on how to start a new custom theme file for a content type. If you use this file, you&#8217;ll notice that, among other things, it prints out the $content variable. All of our CCK fields can be found inside of this variable, along with the default theming of them that you find in the contemplate module&#8217;s teeny, tiny, little box for the template code. So you can take the code that is generated by default in the contemplate module, and insert all of that where you see the $content variable being printed in the tpl file. From there, you can do all of your editing in the editor of your choice without having to strain your back trying to bend closer to your monitor to see what&#8217;s inside of the teeny, tiny, little box.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following my <a href="/rolechanger/">recent post</a> on my <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rolechanger/">rolechanger module</a>, I started delving into how to provide functionality with the resulting dropdown box that the module provides. I wanted to provide all functionality through javascript and have included a rolechanger.js file for this purpose. However I found a few quirks while working with jQuery and the select element.</p>

<p>I started out with a .change() on the select element and drilled down through the .children() looking for [@selected]. However, thought this worked fine in IE, Firefox did not pick this up at all. I saw in the jQuery issues that this had been fixed, but evidently not for the release that ships with Drupal. Here&#8217;s the resulting code for the IE portion:
<code></p>

<pre><code>// ie doesn't pick up the option.click, so we'll have to use the select.change
$('#edit-role-changer').change(function(){

// get rid of select box
$('#edit-role-changer').hide();

    // show the chosen role as static text
   // NOTE: FF doesn't pick up [@selected]
  $('#role').html($(this).children("[@selected]").text()).show();    

  // provide a change link
  $('#role-change-back').show();

});
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>Firefox was actually a little easier to code for, since I found that it would pick up a .click() on the option element. So the resulting code for Firefox is this:
<code></p>

<pre><code>// provide action for an option change
$('#edit-role-changer option').click(function(){      

  // get rid of select box
  $('#edit-role-changer').hide();

  // show the chosen role as static text
  $('#role').html($(this).text()).show();    

  // provide a change link
  $('#role-change-back').show();

});
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>Since Firefox does pick up the .change() function that is on the select element that is used for IE, I then had to do a browsers detection, which jQuery makes simple as pie with $.browser. Here is the resulting full code:
<code>
  // see which browser we're working with
  if ($.browser.msie) {</p>

<pre><code>// ie doesn't pick up the option.click, so we'll have to use the select.change
$('#edit-role-changer').change(function(){

  // get rid of select box
  $('#edit-role-changer').hide();

  // show the chosen role as static text
  // NOTE: FF doesn't pick up [@selected]
  $('#role').html($(this).children("[@selected]").text()).show();    

  // provide a change link
  $('#role-change-back').show();

});
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  else {</p>

<pre><code>// provide action for an option change
$('#edit-role-changer option').click(function(){      

  // get rid of select box
  $('#edit-role-changer').hide();

  // show the chosen role as static text
  $('#role').html($(this).text()).show();    

  // provide a change link
  $('#role-change-back').show();

});
</code></pre>

<p>  }
</code></p>

<p>Happy jQuerying!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So my first commit to the Drupal contributions has been made! WooHoo! I partied hard that night :) No, it&#8217;s really not that big of a deal, but I&#8217;m excited as it takes me one step further into Drupal development and being more involved in the Drupal community.</p>

<p>The module is called <a href="http://drupal.org/projects/rolechanger">rolechanger</a>, and came about when there was a need on a new site I&#8217;m building for work that needs to have a menu&#8217;s links change based upon a chosen role. The roles are created in the main Drupal interface and then you tell rolechanger which roles from that list you would like your users to be able to choose from. Nothing really happens once one of those roles is chosen, at least from a traditional programmatic standpoint since I&#8217;ll be using javascript for the functionality of changing the menu items. The module is somewhat limited in this respect, but I&#8217;ve included a rolechanger.js file in the module&#8217;s directory for this purpose and anyone can edit this to define what happens on change using drupal&#8217;s built in jQuery library. It&#8217;s really more of a widget I suppose, developed for a specific purpose and probably will not have a whole lot of use to anyone other then my current project, but I contributed it anyway just for the purpose of doing so and gaining the experience of committing code through CVS to Drupal&#8217;s repository. Hey, you gotta start somewhere right?</p>

<p>Update: <a href="http://jeradbitner.com/node/16">Also, see my post on using some jQuery code with this module.</a></p>

<p>So Marti Gras weekend was great! I&#8217;m so fraking sore form Wii that it&#8217;s not even funny. Well maybe a little bit funny&#8230; Snugs and his wife were in town as well as Dave, so we all hung out at Dana&#8217;s, drank, and played Wii for 8 hours straight! It was a blast, a good time was had by all. This video is of Dave and Dana boxing, but we bowled a hell of a lot more. We almost all hit pro by the end of the night (3am). Too bad for Amy, who hurt her leg earlier in the day and was not able to bowl very much, but she did pretty well sitting down, even on her Vikoden! We also played with my Mac&#8217;s PhotoBooth program, hilarity ensued. <object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/gYuacuTK_eU"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/gYuacuTK_eU" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>
